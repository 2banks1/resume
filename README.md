Lesperance & Associates
Dundas, ON
Chief Operating Officer (2010 – 2015) http://www.lesperanceassociates.com
Lesperance & Associates is an Immigration Law firm specializing in economic citizenship or tax residence and sometimes US expatriation for Ultra High Net Worth clients and their families. The Managing Partner did not enjoy selling, negotiation, conflict, managing people, or communicating difficult news to clients and advisors. I joined L&A with the mandate to bring a framework of process to this burgeoning law firm. I was the point of contact for all significant relationships with banks and financial institutions, Family Offices, referring advisor firms, relevant government officials, and property developers in St Kitts & Nevis. I stood in the lead position on all negotiations and external communications. I provided leadership to a fragmented office staff by helping everyone be more comfortable with specific responsibilities. This leadership directly led to increased office efficiency and significantly improved profitability.

While building the customer base, I also helped to build the customer support team and the product development team. This proof of concept directly led to a venture capital injection from Slaight Communications and Alberta’s Deal Generator (a University of Alberta sponsored organization). The company was sold 24 months later.
